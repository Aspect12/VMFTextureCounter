# VMFTextureCounter
A very shoddy command thrown together in like 30 minutes used to count the <i>least used textures</i> in a .vmf file. Can be adapted to do other things too if you know what you're doing.<br>
I doubt anyone will find a use for this, but I needed it, so I figured I might as well share it.
# Usage
Drop `vmftexturecounter.lua` into your `garrysmod/lua/autorun/` folder, and type `"CountLeastUsedTextures"` in the in-game console. The two arguments are the map (which you must drop into your `garrysmod/data/` folder) and the number of textures to list.

Don't care.
